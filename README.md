- [Twinklebear/tray\_rust](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust) - Adopts some Physically Based Rendering techniques.
- [lukehoban/rust-raytracer](https://github.com/lukehoban/rust-raytracer/blob/master/src/main.rs) - Another single-file raytracer.
- [gz/rust-raytracer](https://github.com/gz/rust-raytracer) - Several raytracers with increasing complexity.
- [kylc/raytracer](https://github.com/kylc/raytracer) - Another one, lots of modules.
